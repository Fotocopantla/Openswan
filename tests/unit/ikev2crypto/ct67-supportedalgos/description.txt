This test is very similar to libpluto/lp67, in that it creates a bunch of
IKEv1 and IKEv2 policies from an ike= line.  But the libpluto tests do not
generally load many (any) of the crypto modules.  If asked if a particulary
crypto algorithm is loaded, the libpluto tests are mocked out to always say
yes.

This test has a set of traditional (AES, SHA1, SHA2_256) loaded, but not the
legacy ones (3DES, MD5), nor the new fancy ones (GCM, CTR, etc.).

XXX TODO.
