This test case is an IKEv1 initiator -- it exists so that we can test the
reply of an IKEv2-only responder.

It is also used with lp73 thru lp80 to test that IKEv1 progresses through
the quick mode correctly.   While the initiator is behind a NAT, and
so has a random left=%any, the proposal is a definite IPv6 set of subnets.
