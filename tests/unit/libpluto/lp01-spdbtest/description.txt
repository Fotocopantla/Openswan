The purpose of this test case was to exercise the SADB copy code.
The SADB structure and the copy was IKEv1 specific, and IKEv2
versions were produced from the IKEv1.  This is limiting for the IKEv2,
and IKEv1 is obsoleted.

The test case now prints the IKEv2 default structures which are
derived from the libalgoparse defaults.
IKEv2 does not negotiate the AUTH mechanism (and it can even be asymmetric),
so there is not the cross-product of authentication methods and other
parameters needed.

This test case starts by printing all of the possible IKEv2 parameters
that are enabled by default, and then it translates them into IKEv1
options and prints that.  The result is validated to be similiar
to what this test case looked like when it was IKEv1 focused.
