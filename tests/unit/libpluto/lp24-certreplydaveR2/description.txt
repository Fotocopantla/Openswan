This test case is an IKEv2 responder -- it uses a certificate with a wildcard
right= policy that accepts any ID that is properly validated.

This is exactly like lp21-certreplyselfR2, and in fact starts out
identically, getting carol all hooked up, but then it accepts a packet
from *Dave*, and replies to it.

carolI1.pcap is copied from ../lp18-certificateselfI1/OUTPUT/certificateselfI1.pcap
carolI2.pcap is copied from ../lp20-certificateselfI2/OUTPUT/certificateselfI2.pcap

davecertI1.pcap from ../lp23-davecertI1/OUTPUT/davecertI1.pcap
davecertI2.pcap from ../lp26-davecertI2/OUTPUT/parentI2.pcap

Originally the test case did not emit the parentR1dave.pcap, it was produced
because the test was half-run, but now it runs both.


So, in fact the is the daveR1 response, despite being named R2.
