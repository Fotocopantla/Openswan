This test case is an IKEv1 responder, receive I3 message, send the R3.

This tests peel (132.213.238.7) responding to berri, which is behind a NAT,
but proposes a static set of IPv6 subnets.

It is also used with lp73 thru lp80 to test that IKEv1 progresses through
the quick mode correctly.   While the initiator is behind a NAT, and
so has a random left=%any, the proposal is a definite IPv6 set of subnets.
