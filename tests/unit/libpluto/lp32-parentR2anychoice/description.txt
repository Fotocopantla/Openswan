This test case is an IKEv2 responder.
This test case receives a second (I2) packet from the initiator.
In this test case, the responder has two left=%any conns, which differ
by their ID, and therefore have different acceptable rightsubnet=.

This test case validates the responders ability to reject the rightsubnet
that would have matched the conn which was not the one that authenticated.
